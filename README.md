# python_visualizations
python talk on data visualization - focused on matplotlib and bokeh libraries

# Outline - SF Python Lightning Talk 2019.12.04
Bokeh overview
Basic Interactions
Linked Charts & Tables + Saving Data
Elegent intuition - Fourier Transform Visualizations  (extend Bokeh maintainer example)
Live Streaming Data - Audio Spectrogram (extend Bokeh maintainer example)


# Outline - Main talk
### Introduction

### Objectives
Understand why effective visualizations are important

Introduction to the grammar of graphics and how to choose the right visual approach

Get a snapshot of the python visualization universe

Explore Foundation - learn about matplotlib, understand core use cases & pitfalls + ways to make it better, do some live coding

Look at the Future - Learn about the bokeh library, learn about interactive visualizations, even more live coding

### Illustrate Python Visualization universse; compare libaries - Matplotlib ; Bokeh; Plotly


### Matplotlib - 

Matplotlib - use to explore Challenger Disaster Visualization

Matplotlib - explain and demo different APIs

Matplotlib - illustrate simple ways to improve...  & Matplotlib - you need to know it, and how to solve

### Bokeh - the new hotness
Bokeh - syntax, basic cases

Bokeh - interactivity - hover, zoom, pan, linking

Bokeh - key concepts; some ideas 

Bokeh - animation / streaming data
