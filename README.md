### Matplotlib - why it's important

Matplotlib - classic use cases

Matplotlib - some limitations

Matplotlib - why it's horrible

Matplotlib - simple ways to improve...  & Matplotlib - you need to know it, and how to solve

### Bokeh - the new hotness

Also Seaborn and Plotly are nice

Bokeh - benefits
cleaner syntax
interactivity - hover, zoom, pan, linking

Bokeh - key concepts; some ideas

### Animations - 
### Matplotlib -- something; uses images
### Bokeh -- college rankings --> bar chart race
